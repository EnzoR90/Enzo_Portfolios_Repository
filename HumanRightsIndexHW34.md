This fall semester, I am a Teaching Assistant for the course **Conflict, Development, and Human Rights**. It is an interesting class that looks at the impact of conflict in the context of progressing, or the lack thereof, of basic Human Rights. Having done the intellectual dialogue in this space, I was curious to find out what narrative I can spin with just the data as my north star. Hence, for this homework, I looked at the Human Rights Index of the world with the purpose of gathering information on the countries with good Human Rights record vis-a-vis those countries that are lagging when it comes to Human Rights (i.e., this is my initial thesis). I gathered the data from the website *Our World in Data* which reported on the Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem) which the website described as *a project that publishes data and research on democracy and human rights. V-Dem relies on evaluations by around 3,500 country experts and supplementary work by its own researchers to assess political institutions and the protection of rights. The project is managed by the V-Dem Institute, based at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden.* The original data visualization posted in the Our World in Data website is provided below:
