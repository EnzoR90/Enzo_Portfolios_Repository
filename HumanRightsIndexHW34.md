This fall semester, I am a Teaching Assistant for the course **Conflict, Development, and Human Rights**. It is an interesting class that looks at the impact of conflict in the context of progressing, or the lack thereof, of basic Human Rights. Having done the intellectual dialogue in this space, I was curious to find out what narrative I can spin with just the data as my north star. 

**Step 1:** 

For this homework, I looked at the Human Rights Index of the world with the purpose of gathering information on the countries with good Human Rights record vis-a-vis those countries that are lagging when it comes to Human Rights (i.e., this is my initial thesis). I gathered the data from the website *Our World in Data* which reported on the Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem) which the website described as *a project that publishes data and research on democracy and human rights. V-Dem relies on evaluations by around 3,500 country experts and supplementary work by its own researchers to assess political institutions and the protection of rights. The project is managed by the V-Dem Institute, based at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden.* The original data visualization posted in the Our World in Data website is provided below:

**Step 2:**

I provided an in-depth critique of the original data visualization above using Stephen Few's Data Visualization Profile. This evaluation method/tool provided me with a set of criteria to objectively gauge the data visualization against. Here, I evaluated the data visualization based on the following on a 1 to 10 score range (i.e., 1 being the lowest, 10 being the highest): 

*Usesfulness:* Is the data visualization useful

*Completeness:* Does the data visualization showed all information for clarity

*Perceptability:* Is the data visualization easily digestable/undertandable

*Truthfulness:* Does the data visualization show accurate, reliable, and valid information

*Intuitiveness:* Does the data visualization clearly communicates the information

*Aesthetics:* Is the data visualization aesthetically pleasing/enjoyable to the peripheral

*Engagement:* Does the data visualization create inspiration for further learning

The tool is indeed comprehensive, however, I would have wanted to also evaluate the data visualization based on the overall chart design and the layout. I have also mentioned this in the evaluation matrix, with the incorporation of the rationale that granularity on the design evaluation would also be equally important as the informative criterion.

**Step 3:**

Following the evaluation, I then proceeded with my sketches of my planned redesign. For this part, I did the sketches digitally using the wireframing tool *Figma*. As mentioned above, my initial thesis was to find out the countries that have a good and bad HRI. However, I find this to be too simplistic since I realized that the narrative might be lacking. I thought of just showing some countries as my way of comparative analysis, but decided to compare based on the region. Hence, my first sketch shows the continents, Europe, Africa, and Asia, and I included the USA just to highlight whether it is above or below the world average and how it fair with the three continents. To better appreciate the data, I decided to use the data in the last 20 years with the aim of understanding any, or lack of, trends:

For my second sketch, I made it very two-dimensional with very limited data just to assess whether my interviewees would be able to deduce what the information pertains to. Also, I wanted to provide a dichotomy of the first sketch just to get the sense of the audience's preference with the same data provided. I looked at one set of data year which was 2022 to gauge whether it would be better for an audience point-of-view as opposed to multiple data year:

**Step 4:**

Once I completed my sketches, I tested them out to two contemporaries of mine at the university. For this exercise, I just presented the data visualization to them without explaining the content. In lieu of the explanation, I gave them about two minutes to look at the two sketches and emphasized that there are no wrong answers. I deliberately selected the interviewees that are not in the Public Policy and Management program so that to illiminate any bias on the information presented. With this said, they looked at the sketches as part of the regular public which is my aim from the beginning. The following are details of the interviewees' profile and feedback.

*Female Student 1, Mid-20s*

When asked about what Female Student 1 think what they think the visualization is, they answered that they believe it is about Human Rights, freedom of people based on race, gender, rules. They mentioned that the first sketch did not provide clarity on what HRI is about. 

When asked to describe what the visualization is telling them, Female Student 1 said that they can see which countries offer less freedom (i.e., Asia & Africa), and countries that offer more freedom (i.e., Europe & USA), and the value of its evolution over time presented with sketch 1.

Female Student 1 find it surprising that there are less HRI on average in Asia, while not surprise in Africa considering the continent is in turmoil and have more authoritarian ruling. They went on to say that Asia should have more freedom considering the Western influence in the continent.

The intended audience guessed by Female Student 1 was an average person like them or maybe the United Nations.

They highlighted that they would include more information on sketch 1 and 2 for clarity.

*Female Student 2, Mid-20s*

Based on their appreciation of the sketches, Female Student 2 said that the visualization is about Human Rights and what they mean to a particular country. They described what the visualization was telling them based on the continents' HRI that clearly showed those countries that are doing well in providing freedom. They also mentioned that sketch 1 showed volatility or dynamism in the trend year-on-year.

Female Student 2 was surprised to learn that the trajectory of the continents are not upward but more linear, they also noted that nothing is particularly confusing with the visualization.

The target audience for Female Student 2 are policy people, government, or the United Nations.

They noted that they do not have anything to change but highlighted that they prefer the first sketch, and shared that their personal preference is to have minimal colors, from this consideration they said that the sketch 2 was harder to read given the colors.

*Test and Get Feedback: Capture Feedback*

For this in-class exercise, I was grouped with four other **Telling Stories with Data** students. I showed them the two sketches and I made a brevity explanation for each. The feedback I received from the group are the following:

What worked?

Clear comparative analysis of the continents based on the HRI.

What didn't work?

Contrasting color, and some are hard to read.

What suggestions came up?

Provision of a storyline, what do you want the reader to get from the visualization.

What new inspiration arose?

Maybe to only show top and bottom 10 countries based on their HRI. For the story, focus on the change in HRI for these countries from the last 10 years.
