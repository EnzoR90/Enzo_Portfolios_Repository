This fall semester, I am a Teaching Assistant for the course **Conflict, Development, and Human Rights**. It is an interesting class that looks at the impact of conflict in the context of progressing, or the lack thereof, of basic Human Rights. Having done the intellectual dialogue in this space, I was curious to find out what narrative I can spin with just the data as my north star. 

**Step 1:** 
For this homework, I looked at the Human Rights Index of the world with the purpose of gathering information on the countries with good Human Rights record vis-a-vis those countries that are lagging when it comes to Human Rights (i.e., this is my initial thesis). I gathered the data from the website *Our World in Data* which reported on the Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem) which the website described as *a project that publishes data and research on democracy and human rights. V-Dem relies on evaluations by around 3,500 country experts and supplementary work by its own researchers to assess political institutions and the protection of rights. The project is managed by the V-Dem Institute, based at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden.* The original data visualization posted in the Our World in Data website is provided below:

**Step 2:**
I provided an in-depth critique of the original data visualization above using Stephen Few's Data Visualization Profile. This evaluation method/tool provided me with a set of criteria to objectively gauge the data visualization against. Here, I evaluated the data visualization based on the following on a 1 to 10 score range (i.e., 1 being the lowest, 10 being the highest): 

*Usesfulness:* Is the data visualization useful

*Completeness:* Does the data visualization showed all information for clarity

*Perceptability:* Is the data visualization easily digestable/undertandable

*Truthfulness:* Does the data visualization show accurate, reliable, and valid information

*Intuitiveness:* Does the data visualization clearly communicates the information

*Aesthetics:* Is the data visualization aesthetically pleasing/enjoyable to the peripheral

*Engagement:* Does the data visualization create inspiration for further learning

The tool is indeed comprehensive, however, I would have wanted to also evaluate the data visualization based on the overall chart design and the layout. I have also mentioned this in the evaluation matrix, with the incorporation of the rationale that granularity on the design evaluation would also be equally important as the informative criterion.

**Step 3:**
Following the evaluation, I then proceeded with my sketches of my planned redesign. For this part, I did the sketches digitally using the wireframing tool *Figma*. As mentioned above, my initial thesis was to find out the countries that have a good and bad HRI. However, I find this to be too simplistic since I realized that the narrative might be lacking. I thought of just showing some countries as my way of comparative analysis, but decided to compare based on the region. Hence, my first sketch shows the continents, Europe, Africa, and Asia, and I included the USA just to highlight whether it is above or below the world average and how it fair with the three continents. To better appreciate the data, I decided to use the data in the last 20 years with the aim of understanding any, or lack of, trends:
