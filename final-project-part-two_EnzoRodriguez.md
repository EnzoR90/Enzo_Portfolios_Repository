# Wireframes / storyboards
For this part of my final project, I decided to layout my storyboard as outlined in the structure section of the *Final Project I* into shorthand. I created my visualizations using tableau and flourish tools and rendered the respective HTMLs into the shorthand presentation. My shorthand presentation does not provide yet the qualitative side of the story, but I included sub-sections that would hopefully be enough to provide context on the visualizations.

The preview of the shorthand presentation is provided below:

# User research 

## Target audience
My target audience for this presentation are policy makers and the general public in the Philippines. I believe that it is worthwhile to include policy makers as a target audience since my presentation will be discussing how the Philippines is fairing with other neighboring South East Asian Nations. I will also be highlighting the strategic initiatives that the Philippines has done in this space, with the end goal of nudging them to study how the other countries are able to achieve its Financial Inclusion goal in the span of less than a decade. As the paramount audience for this presentation, the general public are extremely valuable since I really want to motivate everyone to have a formal financial access. In order to see this into fruition, I am providing them with the answers to why Financial Inclusion is important, what are the benefits of Financial Inclusion, how are we fairing with other countries and what it says about our own advocacy. This provision of the basic context aims to inform them without feeding them with too much technical information that they will just forget as soon as the presentation is concluded. I really want to manifest to them that there is tangible benefits of owning a formal bank access. To this end, I will include a slide of some financial products available in the market aimed at promoting Financial Inclusion, which I hope that they can easily inquire into and ultimately to pass to their friends and families consequently creating a ripple effect which would lead to bolstered financial access for everyone.

For this part of the project, I decided to interview varied individuals in lieue of the policy makers and the general public. I deemed it appropriate to interview individuals that would be able to relate to the data presented. So I chose four people that I think would be able to provide objective and informed answers to my set of questions. The profiles of the interviewees are detailed in the subsequent discussion.

**First interviewee is a mid-20 female from the South Asia**. Interviewee 1's background is from a non-profit organization (NGO) specializing in the widespread adoption and promotion of greater access to education. I chose her as one of my interviewees since I am curious of what her NGO background would inform her judgment in this specific advocacy. It would be valuable to receive any input she may have for this narrative, aside from any visualization comments she may raise.

**Second interviewee is a mid-20 female from the South America**. Interviewee 2's background is in English literature and pivoted to technological arts. I chose her as one of my interviewees because I want to gauge if she is aware of the concept of Financial Inclusion given the current status of the advocacy in her own country. Her inclusion would benefit my presentation since she will be a proxy of my target audience the general public. Her inputs would be highly effective in understanding whether the presentation is impactful to the general public and whether there are some areas that needs to be addressed to bolster engagement/impact.

**Third interviewee is a mid-20 female from Thailand**. Interviewee 3's background is on the coalesce of policy and technology. I chose her as one of my interviewees because of her relevance in the data that I will be presenting. She is close to reality in Thailand which would aid her in understanding the story I am painting with my presentation. Her comments would be helpful in driving home the point that I wish to achieve here. It would also be interesting if she will raise points on why Thailand's Financial Inclusion is successful and why the adoption of the advocacy is widespread in her country.

**Fourth interviewee is an early-40 male from the Philippines**. Interviewee 4's background is on technological account management with a focus on customer success. I chose him as one of my interviewees because he represents the general public of the Philippines. The presentation is half created with his profile in mind, thus it would be worthwhile to test out the engagement level the presentation provides. His comments are extremely helpful as I navigate to finalize the presentation to fit the narrative to the level that is impactful and comprehensive. This will hopefully maximize the percentage of people with a formal financial access and to disseminate information about this advocacy to the people they know.

All the interviewees answers to the research questions are outlined in the subsequent section and are synthesized following that which will feed into the final edits of the presentation.
