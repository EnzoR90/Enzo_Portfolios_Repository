# Wireframes / storyboards
For this part of my final project, I decided to layout my storyboard as outlined in the structure section of the *Final Project I* into shorthand. I created my visualizations using tableau and flourish tools and rendered the respective HTMLs into the shorthand presentation. My shorthand presentation does not provide yet the qualitative side of the story, but I included sub-sections that would hopefully be enough to provide context on the visualizations and the seamless flow of the narrative.

The preview of the shorthand presentation is provided below:

# User research 

## Target audience
My target audience for this presentation are policy makers and the general public of the Philippines. I believe that it is worthwhile to include policy makers as a target audience since my presentation will be discussing how the Philippines is fairing with other neighboring South East Asian Nations. I will also be highlighting the strategic initiatives that the Philippines has done in this space, with the end goal of nudging them to study how the other countries are able to achieve its Financial Inclusion goal in the span of less than a decade. As the paramount audience for this presentation, the general public are extremely valuable since I really want to motivate everyone to have a formal financial access. In order to see this into fruition, I am providing them with the answers to why Financial Inclusion is important, what are the benefits of Financial Inclusion, how are we fairing with other countries and what it says about our own advocacy. This provision of the basic context aims to inform them without feeding them with too much technical information that they will just forget as soon as the presentation is concluded. I really want to manifest to them that there is tangible benefits of owning a formal financial access. To this end, I will include a slide of some financial products available in the market aimed at promoting Financial Inclusion, which I hope that they can easily inquire into and ultimately to pass to their friends and families consequently creating a ripple effect which would lead to bolstered financial access for everyone.

For this part of the project, I decided to interview varied individuals in lieue of the policy makers and the general public. I deemed it appropriate to interview individuals that would be able to relate to the data presented. So I chose four people that I think would be able to provide objective and informed answers to my set of questions. The profiles of the interviewees are detailed in the subsequent discussion.

**First interviewee is a mid-20 female from India**. Interviewee 1's background is from a non-profit organization (NGO) specializing in the widespread adoption and promotion of greater access to education. I chose her as one of my interviewees since I am curious of what her NGO background would inform her judgment in this specific advocacy. It would be valuable to receive any input she may have for this narrative, aside from any visualization comments she may raise.

**Second interviewee is a mid-20 female from Colombia**. Interviewee 2's background is in English literature and pivoted to technological arts. I chose her as one of my interviewees because I want to gauge if she is aware of the concept of Financial Inclusion given the current status of the advocacy in her own country. Her inclusion would benefit my presentation since she will be a proxy of my target audience the general public. Her inputs would be highly effective in understanding whether the presentation is impactful to the general public and whether there are some areas that needs to be addressed to bolster engagement/impact.

**Third interviewee is a mid-20 female from Thailand**. Interviewee 3's background is on the coalesce of policy and technology. I chose her as one of my interviewees because of her relevance in the data that I will be presenting. She is close to reality in Thailand which would aid her in understanding the story I am painting with my presentation. Her comments would be helpful in driving home the point that I wish to achieve here. It would also be interesting if she will raise points on why Thailand's Financial Inclusion is successful and why the adoption of the advocacy is widespread in her country.

**Fourth interviewee is an early-40 male from the Philippines**. Interviewee 4's background is on technological account management with a focus on customer success. I chose him as one of my interviewees because he represents the general public of the Philippines. The presentation is half created with his profile in mind, thus it would be worthwhile to test out the engagement level the presentation provides. His comments are extremely helpful as I navigate to finalize the presentation to fit the narrative to the level that is impactful and comprehensive. This will hopefully maximize the percentage of people with a formal financial access and to disseminate information about this advocacy to the people they know.

All the interviewees' answers to the research questions are outlined in the subsequent section and are synthesized following that which will feed into the final edits of the presentation.

## Interview script
For this part of project research, I have prepared six questions that I threw at the interviewees after they previewed the shorthand presentation. I specifically provided them with a few minutes to let all the information be digested before I asked them these questions. For the specific goal of each questions, I have provided the detailed explanation below:

| Goal                                                          | Questions to Ask |
|---------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|
| This question is alluding to their comprehension of the topic.|Based on the storyboard, do you feel like Financial Inclusion should be a priority?|
| This question aims to assess whether the flow of the narrative is easy to follow and understand.|Does the narrative of the storyboard cohesive and clear?|
| This question aims to gauge what works in the presentation design.|What do you like most about the storyboard (eg visualizations, color scheme, typography, etc)?|
| This question aims to gauge what does not work in the presentation design.|What do you like least about the storyboard (eg visualizations, color scheme, typography, etc)?|
| This question is alluding to how the audience would be better presented with the narrative. | How do you think the presentation could be improved?|
| This question is driving the point of their comprehension of the topic which complements the first question. | Do you believe that the storyboard is able to capture the intended purpose? Why or why not?|


## Interview findings
Presented herein are the answers to the aforementioned questions from each interviewees. For similar comments, I took the liberty to highlight them for easy reference of the reader and to also check whether these are properly addressed in the final edits of the presentation. These highlighted comments are synthesized in the subsequent section with the proper discussion of how this can be implemented in the final design.

| Questions               | Interviewee 1                  | Interviewee 2 | Interviewee 3 | Interviewee 4 |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| Based on the storyboard, do you feel like Financial Inclusion should be a priority? |1            |2             |Yes.|Yes, it may be long overdue for the PH to be or part of our neighboring Asian brothers who are surpassing us not just technologically but as economically and financially. Banks need to reach out further not just concentrate profit and business in the greater metropolitan area.|
|Does the narrative of the storyboard cohesive and clear?|1                                |2             |Yes.             |All clear about the comparison between countries but need what should be done to do FI.|
|What do you like most about the storyboard (eg visualizations, color scheme, typography, etc)?|1                                |2             |Visualization especially the Proportion of Population with and without Financial Access in Select South East Asian Nations and the Historical FI Index of Select South East Asian Nations|All aspects of it except the parts where you need to explain the strategy.|
|What do you like least about the storyboard (eg visualizations, color scheme, typography, etc)?
The ‘how we move forward from here’ part is missing?|1                                |2             |The **‘how we move forward from here’ part is missing**? Other than that I think the figure of **“Status of FI on Economic Status of Select South East Asian Nations”** is still difficult to understand.|No explanation on FI **strategies**.|
|How do you think the presentation could be improved?|1                                |2             |Same with question 4 answer.|FI **strategies**.|
|Do you believe that the storyboard is able to capture the intended purpose? Why or why not?|1                                |2             |Yes I do. After seeing it I realize how big the issue is in Philippines. I also gain more knowledge by seeing the visualization in comparison with others in SE Asia.|Yes, it explains how graphically pitiful the Philippine’s FI compared to Thailand and
Malaysia. But need to present how to strategies and advertise FI to very far flung people who has no direct access to financial services.|


# Identified changes for Part III
Following the comments received from the interviewees, I provide below the synthesized points of the said comments. Based on these comments, I also included the proposed action on how to implement these in the edits of the final presentation.

| Research synthesis                       | Anticipated changes for Part III                                                |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Provide clarity on the FI proportion based on Economic Status visualization| I intend to include a clear label for each legends to read as "Proportion of the Richest 60% that have Financial Access" and "Proportion of the Poorest 40% that have Financial Access".|
|                                          |                                                                                 |
|                                          |                                                                                 |

| ...add more rows as necessary            |                                                                                 |
