For my personal data visualization design, I chose the data set for the top 5 countries with the highest government debt-to-GDP ratio in my attempt to show how these compare over the years. Based on the data presented, we can clearly say that Greece, Italy, and the US had ratio volatility from 2009 to 2011, while Japan and Spain remained consistent. The glaring observation is that all these countries' trajectory of its debt-to-GDP ratio has been increasing since 2007, with the highest on 2020 and a downtick in 2021.


# IV. Summary Discussion
The three data visualizations presented here have their idiosyncratic rationales for being used to show the narrative the presenter aims to impart to the audience. Like any visualizations, there are good points and room for improvements for these data visualizations. The following discussions wishes to dissect these visualizations for comparisons and also as a learning exercise on critiquing.

The first data visualization from the OECD on the government debt-to-GDP ratio is showing a simple bar graph for a straight-to-the-point comparison of the countries' ratio. The decision to make the labels for each bar visible only upon hovering is smart, I assume that this is to avoid clutterred texts. As an improvement, I wish that the OECD average ratio is a line to put more emphasis on whether countries are below, within, or above the threshold. By doing so, I believe that the visualization would have been more impactful.

The second data visualization with the same data set but with a different design is I believe compatible for people who are visual learners. I imagine that this type of visualization is very useful for top management since these caliber of people are not too focus on the specifics but on a big picture scenario. Given that the visualization shows the graph (i.e., increase or decrease) for each country, visual learners/top management can easily infer the situation with regards to the government debt-to-GDP ratio for a specific country. The provision of specific details when a point is being hovered is very helpful in case there are granular questions that may arise. This type of visualization is indeed a niche, this may work or may not work depending on the appetite of the audience.

The third data visualization, I truncated the data to only show the top 5 highest countries. For the year-on-year ratio, I decided to start from 2007, cognizant of the *global financial crisis*, and ended until 2021 to consider the *COVID-19 pandemic*, my rationale behind this is that I wanted to gauge whether the said crises had any impact on these countries' debt-to-GDP ratio and if there are any improvement or lack thereof over subsequent years. For the chart used, I chose the *line chart race* since I wanted a playful way of showing the comparative analysis while maintaining the audience's focus on what the narrative is. The information presented here is clear and easily digestible since the labels are explicitly defined leaving no room for ambiguity. I opted to keep the labels for each line visible since I wanted to show the change in the ratios as the year progresses, unfortunately there is no option in flourish to only show the values (this is indeed an area for improvement). To reinforce the illusion of a race, I decided to include the image of the country's flag, this may be a redundancy on the country label but overall it is not bothersome. The colors are maintained in the gradient of blue to green so that no line is emphasized more than the other.
