For my personal data visualization design, I chose the data set for the top 4 countries with the highest government debt-to-GDP ratio in my attempt to show how these compare over the years. For the year-on-year ratio, I decided to start from 2007, cognizant of the *global financial crisis*, and ended until 2021 to consider the *COVID-19 pandemic*, my rationale behind this is that I wanted to gauge whether the said crises had any impact on these countries' debt-to-GDP ratio and if there are any improvement or lack thereof over subsequent years. For the chart used, I chose the *line chart race* since I wanted a playful way of showing the comparative analysis while maintaining the audience's focus on what the narrative is. The information presented here is clear and easily digestible since the labels are explicitly defined leaving no room for ambiguity. I opt to keep the labels for each line visible since I wanted to show the change in the ratios as the year progresses, unfortunately there is no option in flourish to only show the values. To reinforce the illusion of a race, I decided to include the image of the country's flag, this may be a redundancy on the country label but overall it is not bothersome. The colors are maintained in the gradient of blue to green so that no line is emphasized more than the other.
