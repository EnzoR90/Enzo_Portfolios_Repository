# Portfolio
This fall 2023, I am taking the course *Telling Stories with Data* at the Carnegie Mellon University. Here you can preview my portfolio designs as I learn and explore more with data visualization contingent to the tools available to me. I cannot wait to take you with me in this journey!

# About me
<img src="ProPic.jpg" width="200"/> 

Mabuhay!  My name is **Kent Laurence** but my preferred name is **Enzo**. I am an international merit scholar from the Philippines studying Master's of Science, Public Policy and Management with Digital Transformation and Analytics concentration. My interest in data visualization stemmed from the nascent utilization in my home country, this made me want to further my knowledge/expertise so that I am able to interpret data in a meaningful and easily digestible manner.

Fan facts about me, I used to be a mountain climber, but since I have no time to do this here in the U.S., I shifted my interest into working out five times a week. I am also a fur parent to two adorable and energetic beagles.

# What I hope to learn
I wish to learn the effective and appropriate visualization techniques that will encompass colour hue selection and aesthetically pleasing layout, inter alia, consequently understanding how it will colleasce with the data narrative to be better appreciated by the audience.

## Homework 2: [Visualizing Government Debt-to-GDP Ratio](DataVisualizationPortfolioHW.md)
This page shows my work on homework 2 that is comprised of three parts. Part 1 is the data visualization on the comparison of the government debt-to-GDP ratio of select countries for 2018 to 2022. Part 2 is the data visualization on the government debt-to-GDP of select countries from 1996 to 2020 following the sparklines design. And Part 3 is my personal data visualization design of the top 5 countries with the highest government debt-to-GDP ratio from 2007 to 2021.

## Homeworks 3&4: [Critique by Design](critique-by-design)
For this assignment, make sure you set up and link to a new page.  This page is linking to a new Markdown document called `critique-by-design.md`.  

# Lab Exercise [News Organization Trust Survey](Trust in News Organizations.md)
Using the tableau application, we were able to replicate the data visualization on News Organization Trust Survey. 

## Final project
*I have not yet decided on what I wish to be my final project will be.*
