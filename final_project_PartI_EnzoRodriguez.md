# Outline
## Project Abstract
 
Why is it important for people to have access to financial services? This is one of the many questions that regulators try to address when we think about **Financial Inclusion**. Is having a bank account enough to guage the impact of this advocacy, or is there a more salient aspect that is just lurking and waiting to be mined?

This topic is an important, and close, advocacy to my country and to me personally. Coming from the Philippines, an archipelago of a country, there are places in the mountainous areas that are not serviceable with electricity and internet connectivity. As building blocks, inter alia, for people to participate in the economic activity of a community, it is indeed a challenge to succeed and have a better life sans all of the tools for you to do so. Hence, it is one of the strategic priorities of the Central Bank of the Philippines to promote Financial Inclusion throughout the country with the end goal of assisting the National Government in eradicating cycles of poverty which plagued most of my countrymen.

The World Bank defines Financial Inclusion as a "method for individuals' and businesses' access to responsible and sustainable delivery of useful and affordable financial products and services that satisfy their respective needs - these financial products and services include transactions, payments, savings, credit and insurance".

When people have access to a transaction account, it gives them the opportunity to save, send, and receive money/payments. This is the main catalyst for people to have greater financial services. The tangible and valuable impact of financial access is shown on how it manifests in the daily lives of people, when people are able to save, send, and receive money/payments then they are better equipped to plan for their families' and businesses' future and account for any unexpected situations they may face. To this end, financial inclusion provides people an equitable chance to better their status of living and to ultimately break the chains of poverty.

Cognizant of the aforementioned discussion, this final project aims to evaluate the Financial Inclusion of the Philippines vis-a-vis its neighboring countries, such as Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam. I wish to paint a picture of how it started, how is it going, and how do these countries plan to further expand the promotion of this advocacy.

> A project structure that outlines the major elements of your story.  Your Good Charts text talks about story structure in Chapter 8 - you should describe what you hope to achieve.  Make sure the outline is detailed enough that we can see how you anticipate your story unfolding.  You can incorporate your Story Arc from the in-class exercise along with your user stories and one sentence summary to make the topic even more clear. 

## Structure

**What is the current status of Financial Inclusion in the World?**

This section will provide the audience a backdrop of what the current worldwide statistics for Financial Inclusion. The aim here is to inform the audience of the real need for Financial Inclusion especially in the underdevelop nations.

**How many people in the Philippines have financial access?**

This section will give the audience the current situation in my home country, the Philippines, in relation to the proportion of its population with financial access. I plan to provide some discussion on the inception of Financial Inclusion in the Philippines and how it paved way to the creation of a regulatory landscape that incentivizes financial institutions to have products/services that promotes financial access for the underprivilege sector of the society.

**What is the situation in the neighboring nations?**

This section will show the audience the proportion of people with financial access in Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam. This will allude to the assessment of how does the Philippines fair with these nations in this specific advocacy.

**Are they doing enough about this advocacy?**

This section will show the historical trend, or the lack thereof, of these countries' promotion of Financial Inclusion by informing the audience of the proportion of the population with financial access for 2011, 2014, 2017, and 2021 (2022 data is not yet complete based on The World Bank repository).

**Is economic status a factor?**

This section will show a comparative analysis of each countries' proportion of the population with a financial account for the poorest 40% and richest 60% (i.e., in income for ages 15+). The aim here is to hopefully show whether there is a wide and narrow gap between these segments of the society.

**How do we move forward from here?**

This section will inform the audience of the strategic plans of the Philippines in the expansion of Financial Inclusion in the country.

**Yes, you can help in the Financial Inclusion promotion too!**

This section will provide the audience with some information on the available products and services offered by financial institutions aimed at promoting Financial Inclusion.

## Initial sketches
The sketches included in this section are just initial ideas on what I envision for the structures above. As a caveat, this may change depending on the final output for this project. I have also included brevity discussion for each sketch so that the audience will be able to understand my thought process or rationale.

*Data on the Financial Inclusion Around the World*
This sketch aims to show the percentage of people for each country that have financial access, this is the measure that we will use for the Financial Inclusion. Here, I decided to use a cartography of the world with color gradient, the darker the color the higher the proportion of population with financial access and the lighter the color the lower the proportion of population with financial access.

*Current situation of Financial Inclusion in the Philippines*
This sketch will compare between the proportion of Philippine population that have financial access and those that do not have financial access. My idea is to show a simple bar graph since I want it to be straight forward.

*Financial Inclusion in neighboring countries*
This sketch aims to inform the audience the proportion of population with Financial Access in select South East Asian Nations. My initial idea is a dichotomous bar graph that shows the proportion with financial access and no financial access. For more clarity, I decided to include the value for each graph.

# The data
For this final project, I decided to source my data from The World Bank specifically their database on the global financial inclusion index that shows select years for each country on important threshold that I prefer to highlight in my narrative. The World Bank is one of the movers when it comes to the global promotion of Financial Inclusion, in fact this advocacy is considered as one of the enablers for their sustainable development goals. 

The specific dataset provides me with the necessary index that I plan to transform into the data visualization that I will show in the sections mentioned above. The website is very convenient since it is like a one stop shop for all relevant indeces in the space. The details of the website is provided below:

Name: Global Financial Inclusion
URL: https://databank.worldbank.org/source/global-financial-inclusion

The second website I decided to use is from the Central Bank of the Philippines that discusses specifically the Financial Inclusion national strategy in the country. I plan to incorporate this discussion in the sections as highlighted in the structure above. The information that will be gathered here will help me provide context on the current situation in the country, what regulations have been ratified that are aimed at its promotion, and most especially this will inform the audience of some of financial products/services that are already in the market so that they will know what to inquire about.

Name:Inclusive Finance
URL: https://www.bsp.gov.ph/SitePages/InclusiveFinance/InclusiveFinance.aspx 

All the data from the websites above are all publicly available, hence their use will not be prohibited.

# Method and medium
The final project will be completed using shorthand as the main backdrop for unfolding the story and showing the data visualizations. For the creation of the data visualizations, I plan to utilize flourish and tableau. Depending on the graph design, I may have to do a process of iteration just to see which is the most appropriate that consequently will provide an aesthetically pleasing result.
