# The final data story
<script src="https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/Financial-Inclusion/embed.js"></script>

The final data story is completed using the medium shorthand. I decided to segment my data story into nine that builds upon each discussion that better emphasizes the narrative of the need for further promotion of Financial Inclusion advocacy in the Philippines. I deliberately started the data story with a write-up on the official description of Financial Inclusion and explained why this advocacy matters and/or important. To better capture the value of the advocacy, I also added a write-up on the risks associated with people having no Financial Access on macro- and micro-level.

Overall, the visualizations are embedded in sections III - VII with a brevity discussion on what the story is highlighting in that particular visualization. Personally, this is very helpful for me whenever I present the story since it provides me with the concepts that I will be able to concisely discuss to the audience. For the list of the sections in my data story, provided below are as follows:

I. Abstract

II. Risk of No Financial Inclusion

III. World Wide Financial Inclusion Index

IV. Philippine Financial Inclusion

V. South East Asian Nation (SEAN) Index

VI. Historical SEAN

VII. Economic Status SEAN

VIII. The Philippines Strategy

IX. Financial Inclusion Products

# Changes made since Part II 
For my final visualization design, one of the major changes I instituted is the background color for my graphs. In Part II, all their backgrounds were white which an interviewee has pointed out that it is not cohesive with the overall theme. So, I ensure that the backgrounds and the slide color is similar by specififying their RBG codes. Shorthand was very convenient in instituting these changes since the tool has the background color setting that specifies the current background color.

Another change that I instituted for my visualizations is pivoting the colors for the graphs to a neutral and aesthetically complementary to the data story motif. The original color for my graphs were a hue of blue and green which is contrasting to the dark aesthetic of my data story motif. I find that the hitherto visualizations tend to overpower the slide which is not my goal to begin with. So, I decided to use a dark hue of blue and green that blends more beautifully with my motif.

As one interviewee pointed out, my data story in Part II lacked information on the risks associated to not having a Financial Access. Hence, I decided to include a slide dedicated to this discussion. I researched on studies that described the risks of not having a Financial Access, which I was able to find through the International Monetary Fund. I embedded this reference in the specific slide with the inclusion of the macro- and micro-level discussion of the risks. To capture the gravity of these risks, I incorporated images that are properly cited specifically on the lack of education and poverty. 

To better provide clarity on the Status of Financial Inclusion on Economic Status for South East Asian Nations, I decided to change the labels to be explicit on what is data being shown about. For this part, I changed the labels to Proportion of Richest 60% with F.A. (Financial Access) and Proportion of Poorest 40% with F.A. This means that the data showed is a percentage point of the proportion of the group (i.e., Richest 60% or Poorest 40%) for each country.

As pointed out by majority of my interviewees, the missing discussion on the strategy needs to be completed. For this part, I gathered the information in the discussion from the Central Bank of the Philippines reference website. I specifically cited the 2022 Report on National Strategy for Financial Inclusion of the country. This report has aided me in my discussion of the salient points of the strategic initiatives/programs the country is instituting to further address the gap in the Financial Access of the middle to high income segment vis-a-vis the low income segment and ultimately further the promotion of the advocacy to the masses.

Lastly, for my call to action slide, I initially decided to list the available financial products/services to the public. However, I realized that in order to nudge people to do something, I must create an action-oriented scenario. So, instead of just listing the products, I deliberately curated the products in the market that are dedicated for individuals and for entrepreneurs by providing a QR code of these products that will redirect the audience, once they scan the QR code, to the specific descriptions of the products. These provide ample information on its usage and the various financial institutions that are offering them so that the audience know where and whom to ask for the application/registration.
