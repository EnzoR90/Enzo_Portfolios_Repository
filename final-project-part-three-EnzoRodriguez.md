# The final data story
<script src="https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/Financial-Inclusion/embed.js"></script>

The final data story is completed using the medium shorthand. I decided to segment my data story into nine that builds upon each discussion that better emphasizes the narrative of the need for further promotion of Financial Inclusion advocacy in the Philippines. I deliberately started the data story with a write-up on the official description of Financial Inclusion and explained why this advocacy matters and/or important. To better capture the value of the advocacy, I also added a write-up on the risks associated with people having no Financial Access on macro- and micro-level.

Overall, the visualizations are embedded in sections III - VII with a brevity discussion on what the story is highlighting in that particular visualization. Personally, this is very helpful for me whenever I present the story since it provides me with the concepts that I will be able to concisely discuss to the audience. For the list of the sections in my data story, provided below are as follows:

I. Abstract

II. Risk of No Financial Inclusion

III. World Wide Financial Inclusion Index

IV. Philippine Financial Inclusion

V. South East Asian Nation (SEAN) Index

VI. Historical SEAN

VII. Economic Status SEAN

VIII. The Philippines Strategy

IX. Financial Inclusion Products

# Changes made since Part II 
For my final visualization design, one of the major changes I instituted is the background color for my graphs. In Part II, all their backgrounds were white which an interviewee has pointed out that it is not cohesive with the overall theme. So, I ensured that the backgrounds and the slide color are similar by specififying their RBG codes. Shorthand was very convenient in instituting these changes since the tool has the background color setting that specifies the current background color, hence I just copied those and pasted over flourish.

Another change that I instituted for my visualizations is pivoting the colors for the graphs to a neutral and aesthetically complementary to the data story motif. The original color for my graphs were a hue of blue and green which was contrasting to the dark aesthetic of my data story motif. I find that the hitherto visualizations tend to overpower the slide which is not my goal to begin with. So, I decided to use a dark hue of blue and green that blends more beautifully with my motif.

As one interviewee pointed out, my data story in Part II lacked information on the risks associated to not having a Financial Access. Hence, I decided to include a slide dedicated to this discussion. I researched on studies that described the risks of not having a Financial Access, which I was able to find through the International Monetary Fund website. I embedded this reference in the specific slide with the inclusion of the macro- and micro-level discussion of the risks. To capture the gravity of these risks, I incorporated images that are properly cited specifically on the lack of education and poverty. 

To better provide clarity on the Status of Financial Inclusion on Economic Status for South East Asian Nations, I decided to change the labels to be explicit on what is data being shown about. For this part, I changed the labels to Proportion of Richest 60% with F.A. (Financial Access) and Proportion of Poorest 40% with F.A. This means that the data showed is a percentage point of the proportion of the group (i.e., Richest 60% or Poorest 40%) for each country. 

Based on the in-class critiquing exercise, one salient point that the group raised was that the bar graphs showed were ambigous especially if the audience will not have sufficient time to digest the visualizations. The original graph showed both the proportion of the population with Financial Access and the proportion without Financial Access, so the graphs' total were 100% for all countries. This created ambiguity because it was hard to decipher which country has the highest and lowest proportion given the same height of the graphs. So, I decided to focus on one proportion which is the proportion of population with Financial Access, by doing so, the audience can visually assess which countries are the highest and lowest.

As pointed out by majority of my interviewees, the missing discussion on the strategy needs to be completed. For this part, I gathered the information in the discussion from the Central Bank of the Philippines reference website. I specifically cited the 2022 Report on National Strategy for Financial Inclusion of the country. This report has aided me in my discussion of the salient points of the strategic initiatives/programs the country is instituting to further address the gap in the Financial Access of the middle to high income segment vis-a-vis the low income segment and ultimately further the promotion of the advocacy to the masses.

For my call to action slide, I initially decided to list the available financial products/services to the public. However, I realized that in order to nudge people to do something, I must create an action-oriented scenario. So, instead of just listing the products, I deliberately curated the products in the market that are dedicated for individuals and for entrepreneurs by providing a QR code of these products that will redirect the audience, once they scan the QR code, to the specific descriptions of the products. These provide ample information on its usage and the various financial institutions that are offering them so that the audience know where and whom to ask for the application/registration.

Lastly, following the comments and suggestions by Professor Christopher Goranson for my submission of Part II, I decided to incorporate a brevity discussion on the legend for my worldwide Financial Inclusion Index to better provide clarity on what it means. And for my call to action slide, I added a clickable button that will redirect the reader to the specific website of each products shown.

## The audience
My original target audience included (i) policy makers, and the (ii) general public. I wanted to target the former since I believe that it is paramount for them to be informed of the comparative analysis that I made with the neighboring South East Asian Nations. I thought that it would provide an avenue for these policy makers to articulate the necessary plans/strategies that will nudge the advocacy further towards greater financial access. However, when I did my write-up on the stategic direction of the Philippines, I realized that policy makers are already aware of the situation and are actually making great strides in the space towards greater Financial Inclusion. A very comprehensive 2022-2028 National Strategy has already been ratified which led me to my decision to forgo their inclusion in my target audience.

For my final target audience, I only focused on the general public. This will be complementary to the National Strategy for Financial Inclusion set in motion by the National Government. For my final data story, my goal for the general public still remains the same. I want to inform them of why is Financial Inclusion important, what are the benefits of Financial Inclusion, how are we fairing with other countries and what it says about our own advocacy. Staying true to my initial plan, I really want to focus on the concept of the importance of having financial access. My story line builds upon this narrative, so that each discussion will add more weight than the previous discussion, thereby creating impact and honing further this idea. Each visualizations are deliberately chosen and included in the slide that will be easy to understand by the audience, I also ensure that my write-up for the data story will not have too much jargons and that anyone from the general public would easily understand. 

Setting the narrative as mentioned above, I wanted to also inform the audience of the many projects set forth by the National Government to progress the advocacy. My rationale behind this is to create an "Aha" moment, wherein the audience will be aware that this is not a novice concept and that the government is serious in its goal of creating a robust Financial Inclusion. Doing so would also benefit the audience in a sense that they will know how to appropriately inquire their respective Local Government Units on the reason why they are not seeing enough about the promotion of the advocacy, in the event that this is the case. Consequently, keeping all the public leaders accountable to the projects under the National Strategy that is catalytic in the erradication of poverty.

To hit the story home, I also provided the target audience information on some select financial products currently in the market. Since I know that all the audience have smart devices, I made it easy for them to look up these products by providing them a QR code that they can scan. This will also aid in my goal of increased promotion, since it is very convenient to take a picture of the slide with the QR code wherein they can immediately send to their social media chat groups.

# Final thoughts
Overall, I really enjoyed creating my data story from the various medium and methods available to us. I am privilege to learn these from Professor Goranson, that led to me to effectively use them in the final visualization and data story design. I absolutely love the creative process that is involved in the finalization of the design, I took it upon myself to really be thoughtful on each steps of the process since I believe that something will float that I would never think by just doing one go of the final design.

As evidence of my discussion above, I was able to add nuanced changes as explicitly discussed in my *Changes made since Part II* section. The valuable inputs received from my interviewees helped me a lot in making the final data story be more impactful and comprehensive for my target audience. The iterative process through critiquing, I believe, is such a great additional tool for this course given the varied perspectives other people can provide to the author thereby widening the net of ideas that can be mined to ensure that the goal of the author is achieved.

I also appreciate the github page that is required for all of us, since the course is able to provide tangible output that we students can use for application for prospective careers. As someone who had no online portfolio for any data visualizations, the github page is such a useful addition to my skillsets that I can highlight in my curriculum vitae. The layout of the page is done in such a way that it is easy for the reader to understand the visualizations showed, so it will not be worrisome to provide the link to any prospective employers since I am confident that they will be able to follow the flow of the discussion. And since I made sure to be thoughtful in all my write-ups, I believe that I would be able to effectively explain all the visualizations in the github page since I added a personal touch to all my work.
